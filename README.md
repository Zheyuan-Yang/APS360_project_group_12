1. train_test_model.py

   In the train model function, all model state files and training csc files are saved at model folder. Uncomment line 83-85 and line 109-111 to enable cuda. To run it on colab, create a folder called model on the root directory. You can also change the path in `get_model_path` and `get_csv_path` if you want.
